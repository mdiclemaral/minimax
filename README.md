# Minimax

May 2021

In this project, an 8-tile game with 3 competing agents is created.
3 different algorithms, namely minimax, minimax_rand and alpha-beta pruning were implemented.

In minimax and alpha-beta pruning, all three agents were rational while in minimax_rand
a gent 2 and 3 are doing random moves. (the first move that was created)

Agent 1 can only move the odd tiles, agent 2 can only move the even tiles while agent 3 can move all tiles.


Runs with: 

python3 minimax.py game_type init_state goal_state depth solution
